Hi, I’m @Steuard, a theoretical physicist teaching at Alma College, where I'm the chair of our Department of Physics and Engineering (at least as of 2021). Honestly, I haven't done a lot here: I started using Mercurial shortly after Mozilla settled on that platform, and I haven't really needed to change. But git has become a de facto standard, so I'd better learn something about it.

I've been teaching my students how to code in Python, at least a little, which has been fun since I don't precisely know python myself (but hey, know one language know them all, right?).

To get in touch, honestly, just search for my first name: I'm pretty easy to find.
